# cookiecutter-task

This is a [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) template designed to help you get started with your data modeling project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
```

### Using the Template

#### Step One: Build the project.
You can build a project directly from the github repository.

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/patdaburu/cookiecutter-task
```

#### Run the `make` Targets

The template contains a cookiecutter [post-generate hook](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/hooks.html) that will attempt to do the following using targets in the project's [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/):

You may want to go about this differently according to your processes, but if you want to create a virtual environment for the project, install the dependencies, and set up the comman-line application, you can use the `make` targets defined in the project like so.

There are several other `make` targets so have a look at the `Makefile` if you're interested.

```bash
cd <project-name>
make venv
make install
make build
```

#### Run the Command-Line App

If you have performed the steps above, you should now be able to run the application by the project name.

```bash
<project-name> --help
```

If you get the template help message, you're ready to start building.

## Project Features

The project you create from this template has a few features to be aware of including:

* a starter [Luigi](https://luigi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#) task;
* a [click](http://click.pocoo.org/5/) application that you can use to create the data model in your database;
